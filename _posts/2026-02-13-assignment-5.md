I know that I do not have to make this post, however this website does not look great with only three posts, so this one should decently fill out the home page. Adapting this home page to my old blog was not all too hard, although it did take me some time to understand how this template was structured and how to edit it. It is way more complex than the Jekyll theme we used for assignment 2, so there was some stuff I decided to remove, such as the comment functionality. To also fill this theme out, I attached a picture of some nice trees!
