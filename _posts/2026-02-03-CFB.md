I have long been a fan of college football and this past season was no different. What distinguishes it from any pro sports that may be arguably better is its sheer insanity and volume games. After watching many, many hours of it over the fall, here are some of my takeaways.
* It is still hard to believe that Indiana won the national title after being so historically awful. It wouldn't be possible without NIL and the transfer portal.
* Lane Kiffin is still one of the great shameless characters in the sport. His ugly exit from Ole Miss to LSU almost made me feel bad for Ole Miss fans. 
* The new 12 team playoff is great and far better than the 4 team one.
* The new super-conferences aren't. Thanks ESPN.
* Despite watching a lot of football last fall, I did not watch a lot of the Razorbacks during their depressing 2-10 campaign. This past decade of Arkansas football has been bleak. Maybe Ryan Silverfield turns it around, but I'll believe it when I see it.
