I felt that I had a decently easy time completing [assignment 3](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/labs/jekyllmods.html). For part 1, I just had to move some code around to get the header to look as it should. I also enjoyed an excuse to say some things about football in my cfb post on the site. I did try to put some thought into the css changes for the site. I think that I have a decent color scheme for the website currently. I did have to do a bit of [looking](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54138066/changing-the-font-in-jekyll-minima-default-theme) to figure out how to put in a new font, but the solution was not hard at all. I am looking forward to adding to this site and making it more personal. I have attached some images last week's snow below.
